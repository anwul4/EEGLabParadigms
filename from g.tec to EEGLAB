# first time you process you data from g.Tec to EEGLAB do the following. 

in g.Tec open the g.MONcreator module 
specify which channel belongs to which electrode location 
when done safe the montage. 

now open up EEGLAB - be sure to have the two g.tec import plug-ins installed 
one for the dataset and one for importing location.
load in the montage file into matlab 
inside the preprocessing folder there is a subfolder with a file called NewMon2EEGlab.m. 
open it. 
now simply use this function to create a location file EEGLAB can understand by writing something like
NewMon2EEGlab(Mon,'locations.xyz')
in Matlab.
the .xyz is important as EEGLAB will understand this as the location file. 
now you have your location file ready. 
and you are ready to run the first preprocess file in the preprocessing folder called 'filtersAndLocation.m'
